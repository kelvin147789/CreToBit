Welcome to CreToBit

Decentralized Bank Protocol

Proof of Credit (PoC)

What is Proof of Credit ?

 

In DeFi ecosystem, there are serval economic , right now most of them is Proof of Stake (POS) or Proof of Work (POW) . Nevertheless in most of time , it only benefits early adopter , and make investor in after to suffer from price dropping and time-consuming to recover.

Therefore, we propose a new tokenomic which is called "Proof of Credit" (PoC). More credit user have, more asset user is able to use. Also, it values long-term investor by increasing their purchasing power when the asset in contract increase to certain level.In result the more you contribute and commit to the contract, the more you can use for.

In Proof of Credit (PoC), everyone can start their position in anytime without losing too much advantages.Investor who is trustworthy and long-term would definitely get the biggest reward, also user with honesty can also use the contract seamlessly and benefited from.

​

CreToBit encourages user to make use of their asset maximumly. 
​

User can borrow asset anytime with their CTB token, and payback as long as they are making enough profit for trading or investing in another asset.

​

User would payback because of reward for each token , when the asset in contract reach certain level.

Borrow,Payback,Initial and Reward
​

The ultimate goal of CreToBit is for providing fully decentralized banking server for user without concerning too much about opportunity cost.And provide opportunity for user in need.

​

More details and asset would be added in the future.This project is still in beta, use it at your own risk.

​

​

You don't need a large amount of CTB, but you do need at least > 0 amount of CTB to start to ensure rights and interest for CTB holder.

​


If a new user want to get 100 CTB, it doesn't necessary from exchange.Instead, the user can send asset directly to our protocol, and borrow asset from contract, and payback with remaining target purchase. So that the user can get expected CTB without huge slippage from exchange.

​

Example:
​

Expected purchase: 100 CTB = [Total] , 1%[Total] = 1 CTB

​
Initial: 100%[Total] Asset (ETH/BNB) to protocol


​
Result : 90 CTB received
